Account policies are just a set of configuration parameters that can be defined on user accounts and computer accounts. Access policies are conditions granting or denying access. An example of an access policy can be network location (like being required to use a VPN outside of the workspace's network), time-based (when you log into a session, you can only be logged in for "x" amount of time), IP address, and subnet. Geolocation is used to identify users based on their location (when they log into a device on their user). For example, a user logs into their account from home (Chicago), hours later the same user is logged in but the geolocation says it's now being logged in from a connection in China. That's called a "risky login". The travel time from where the original login was, to where the next login is, is suspicious. Geofencing is location-based logical boundaries. If you're inside of the "fence", you are within locational parameters' to access the specific resource that has geofencing. Another example would be Netflix region locking content, or target geofenced advertisements. Geotagging is attaching location-based metadata. It's attaching that location based metadata to wherever you're logging in from. An example would be when someone shares where they "checked in" at on Facebook to share what location they're at.
