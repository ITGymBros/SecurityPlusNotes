Kerberos was developed by MIT. It's an open-source technology. Kerberos has time-sensitive authentication (so if a computer's internal clock is not synced properly, the whole Kerberos authentication process will fail.) Kerberos is a default authentication mechanisms inside of Microsoft Active Directory (since Microsoft 2000).

Kerberos Components:
	Authentication Server
	Key Distribution Center
	Ticket-Granting Ticket
	Ticket-Granting Service

A user will send an authentication request to the Kerberos Server, provide the required information (user/password), the Kerberos Server will verify authentication and provide the user with an encrypted TGT. Once the user has received this TGT it will then be stored on the user's machine. That TGT is time stamped, so if the device that holds that TGT at some point loses time synchronization with the Kerberos Server, it will not be able to authenticate till the machine is brought back onto the domain and is resynchronized/authenticated. If the TGT is valid, the Kerberos Server will provide the user's machine with another ticket called the session key. This session key is what's used so the user is able to gain access to their resources.
