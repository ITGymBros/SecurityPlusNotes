Authentication protocols are created to authenticate identities (users and devices). Password authentication protocol challenges a user wanting access with wanting a valid username and password. If the user is able to provide a valid username and password, PAP will authenticate the user, but if the user does not provide a valid user/password they will not be granted authentication. PAPs entire purpose was to allow you to authenticate, but it had no way of protecting passwords used to grant access. If a hacker was packet sniffing the wire while someone is trying to authenticate with their valid user/password, PAP had no way of encrypting that authentication process, allowing hackers to successfully sniff and capture packets containing people's user/passwords. Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol (CHAP) was the replacement/solution to PAPs insecure issues. CHAP is the same, challenging the user who wants to gain access with credentials like a username and password, only the entire handshake process is encrypted from when the user types the information in. CHAP variants, CHAP (used in non-Windows environments), MS-CHAP (Microsoft's CHAP implementation/weak), MS-CHAPv2 (This has mutual authentication/stronger cryptographic keys).
