Tokens **authenticate** identities, they electronically store personal information, with or without a password. **Connected tokens** are physical devices like YubiKey, FIDO, or smartcards for example. Connected tokens contain digital information on the physical device that verifies you are who you say you are. **Disconnected tokens** do not require a physical connection like physical tokens do. Examples of disconnected tokens are apps/devices like **MFA/2FA** that generate temporary codes that allow you authentication. The last type of token is a **contactless token**. Examples of contactless tokens are contactless payment options on phones or watches like Google Pay/Apple Pay/Android Pay.

One Time Passwords are similar to disconnected tokens, but they are not identical. There are multiple types of OTPs. **HMAC-based OTPs** are an older type of OTP. You receive an authentication code similarly to disconnected tokens, but HMAC OTP tokens **do not expire** until they are used. HMAC OTPs are not recommended due to the security risk of that token being stolen by someone else to gain access before the legitimate user can authenticate with it. **Time-based OTPs** were created to solve this problem, they are like HMAC-OTP, but **they will expire without use**.
