Biometrics are physical characteristics of the user, commonly added to 2FA. One of the most common biometrics is using a **fingerprint** to authenticate. **Voice recognition** systems are another form of possible biometric authentication methods. Hand geometry scanners, retina/iris scanner, facial recognition (FaceID/Windows Hello), veins, and gait analysis (identifying how someone uniquely walks) are all other forms of biometric authentication methods.

Efficacy rates in biometrics. False rejection rate (FRR) is considered a type 1 error. The authorized user is rejected when attempting to authenticate using biometric methods. False acceptance rate (FAR) is known as a type 2 error. This is when an unauthorized user is granted access using biometrics. **Crossover error rate** (CER), this is also called **equal error rate** (EER), the crossover is referring to the crossover point between FAR and FRR. That crossover point **defines how accurate** your biometric system is. The lower the crossover point is, the more accurate/secure the biometric system will be.
