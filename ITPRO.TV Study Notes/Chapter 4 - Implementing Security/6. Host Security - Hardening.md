### Hardening - Basics
* Credentials
	* Change defaults
* Account Management
	* Administrative Accounts
* Default Configurations
	* OS
	* Applications
* Patch Management

Hardening - Firmware Protection
* UEFI vs. MBR
* Updates (patch management)
* Trusted Platform Modules
* Secure Boot
	* Security feature designed to prevent malicious software from loading when your PC boots.
	* Only going to allow trusted, signed with digital signatures, boot loaders to bootstrap the operating system.
* Protection out-of-band management
	* This management is a nodegrid net services method of remotely controlling and managing critical IT assets and network equipment using a secure protocol connection through a secondary interface that is physically separate from the primary network connection.

### Hardening - Ports and Services
* Ports
	* Logical end-point connection
	* Identifies a service
	* Can be used by attackers
* Services
	* Provides networking resources
	* Increased attack surface
	* Can be exploited by attackers

### Hardening - Firewalls
* Implicit deny
* Services
* HIDS/HIPS
* Stateful monitoring

### Hardening - Anti-virus
* Real time protection
* Automated scanning
* Platform and signature updates
* Logging
* Configure default actions
	* Setting the behavior or response that a security control or device should take when encountering network traffic or events that do not match any specific rules or conditions.
		* For example: The anti-virus software identifies a virus on the system, the default action for that specific anti-virus software may be that the software first identifies there is a threat, quarantines the threat, logs that incident, then deletes the threat from the system.

### Hardening - File and Disk Encryption
* File encryption
	* EFS
	* APFS
	* GPG
* Disk encryption
	* BitLocker
		* On Windows
	* File Vault
		* On MacOS
	* LUKS
		* On Linux based systems

### Hardening - Registry
* Windows only
* Hierarchical settings/configuration database
* Least privilege
	* Admins - modify
	* Standard users - read access
